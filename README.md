⋆⁺｡˚⋆˙‧₊☽ SOME NOTES ☾₊‧˙⋆˚｡⁺⋆
- choose any function to work on :p
- selectBattle > selectPlayer
  - not sure if we should implement pointers per player, and not sure how to implement that yet if ever (hence, why I might delay it a lil bit hehe)
  - but, I've already started work on it (will post it once I come up with a solution
- alsoooo is it ok if we make another file for each main function and just call that in the main file? or should we only have one file (.c) for the whole project?
- I think we need to work on selectComPetDium > viewBattlePets first because we need to call it in selectBattle




⋆⁺｡˚⋆˙‧₊☽ CURRENT TASKS ☾₊‧˙⋆˚｡⁺⋆
- Janelle: a bit of everything; but will focus on selectComPetDium > viewBattlePets > initial list of BattlePets
- Nyka:
