⋆⁺｡˚⋆˙‧₊☽ SOME NOTES ☾₊‧˙⋆˚｡⁺⋆
- choose any function to work on :p
- MP uses code modularization
  - each main function is in a different .c file, which is included in main.c
  - all definitions, structures, and function prototypes are also declared in definitions.h
- while selectComPetDium is mostly done, it needs the following updates:
  - documentation
  - file manipulation
- also work on selectBattle documentation
