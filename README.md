⋆⁺｡˚⋆˙‧₊☽ SOME NOTES ☾₊‧˙⋆˚｡⁺⋆

- choose any function to work on :p
- selectBattle > selectPlayer
  - not sure if we should implement pointers per player, and not sure how to implement that yet if ever (hence, why I might delay it a lil bit hehe)
  - but, I've already started work on it (will post it once I come up with a solution
- alsoooo is it ok if we make another file for each main function and just call that? or should we only have one file (.c) for the whole project?


⋆⁺｡˚⋆˙‧₊☽ PROGRESS SO FAR ☾₊‧˙⋆˚｡⁺⋆
