⋆⁺｡˚⋆˙‧₊☽ SOME NOTES ☾₊‧˙⋆˚｡⁺⋆
- choose any function to work on :p
- selectBattle > selectPlayer
  - not sure if we should implement pointers per player, and not sure how to implement that yet if ever (hence, why I might delay it a lil bit hehe)
  - but, I've already started work on it (will post it once I come up with a solution)
- MP uses code modularization -> each main function is in a different .c file
- while selectComPetDium is mostly done, it needs the following updates:
  - documentation
  - file manipulation
